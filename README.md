Project Details
Project Title: MyGo Chic Online Store Management System
Problem Statement:
Many small online clothing stores rely on Instagram for sales but lack a proper e-commerce platform to manage products, orders, and customers efficiently. This leads to challenges such as order tracking issues, difficulty in managing inventory, and lack of insights into customer behavior.
Solution Proposed:
We propose developing a web-based platform for mygo.chic that integrates with Instagram, allowing users to:
	•	Browse and filter products easily.
	•	Add items to a cart and complete purchases.
	•	Provide store admins with a dashboard to manage inventory, orders, and promotions.
	•	Offer analytics to improve marketing strategies.
Project Scope:
Aim:
To build an efficient and user-friendly e-commerce system for mygo.chic, enhancing its online presence and order management.

	1.	Develop a responsive web application with an intuitive UI.
	2.	Implement a secure authentication system for users and admins.
	3.	Provide a shopping cart and checkout process with payment integration.
	4.	Enable admins to manage inventory and orders easily.
	5.	Ensure data security and encryption for user transactions.
Application Description:
The MyGo Chic Online Store Management System will be a web-based platform where customers can browse clothing items, filter products, add them to a cart, and place orders. The admin panel will allow store owners to update stock, manage orders, and analyze sales trends. The system will also support Instagram integration for product visibility.
